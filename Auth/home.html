            <li>What is the scope of a lambda expression?
            <div class="answer">The scope of a lambda expression is the same as the scope of the enclosing block. It can access final or effectively final variables from the enclosing scope.</div>
            </li>
            <li>Can lambda expressions throw exceptions?
            <div class="answer">Yes, lambda expressions can throw exceptions. If the functional interface's abstract method declares a checked exception, the lambda expression can throw that exception.</div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you handle exceptions in lambda expressions?
            <div class="answer">You can handle exceptions in lambda expressions by using a try-catch block within the lambda expression.

            <li>What is the purpose of the PATCH method in REST?
                <div class="answer">The PATCH method is used to partially update a resource on the server. It sends data to the server to update part of the resource.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is the purpose of the HEAD method in REST?
                <div class="answer">The HEAD method is used to retrieve the headers of a resource without fetching the resource itself. It is similar to the GET method but does not return the body of the response.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is the purpose of the OPTIONS method in REST?
                <div class="answer">The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource. It returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified resource.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is statelessness in REST?
                <div class="answer">Statelessness in REST means that each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client context between requests.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is a resource in REST?
                <div class="answer">A resource in REST is an object or representation of something that can be accessed via a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Resources are the key abstraction of information in REST.</div>

            <li>What is a URI in REST?
                <div class="answer">A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string of characters used to identify a resource in REST. It provides a way to access the resource using a unique address.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is the difference between a URI and a URL?
                <div class="answer">A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string that identifies a resource, while a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of URI that provides the means to locate the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (e.g., its network location).</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is HATEOAS in REST?
                <div class="answer">HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a constraint of REST that allows clients to dynamically navigate resources by providing hypermedia links with the responses. It enables discoverability of actions and resources.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is content negotiation in REST?
                <div class="answer">Content negotiation in REST is a mechanism that allows clients and servers to agree on the format of the data to be exchanged. It is achieved using HTTP headers such as Accept, Content-Type, and others.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is the purpose of the Accept header in REST?
                <div class="answer">The Accept header in REST is used by the client to specify the media types that it can process. The server uses this information to return the appropriate representation of the resource.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is the purpose of the Content-Type header in REST?
                <div class="answer">The Content-Type header in REST is used by the client or server to specify the media type of the resource being sent. It indicates the format of the data in the request or response body.</div>

                <li>What is the Single Responsibility Principle?
                    <div class="answer">The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.</div>
                </li>
                <li>What is the Open/Closed Principle?
                    <div class="answer">The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.</div>
                </li>
                <li>What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?
                    <div class="answer">The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.</div>
                </li>
                <li>What is the Interface Segregation Principle?
                    <div class="answer">The Interface Segregation Principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. It suggests splitting large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.</div>

            <h2>SAGA Pattern</h2>

                <li>Defining the Saga Pattern
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>A Saga is nothing but a sequence of local transactions. These local transactions are occurring at the service level. Whenever a local transaction occurs, it publishes a message or an event. Such an event is responsible for triggering the next transaction in the Saga.</p>
                        <p>But then, you might ask what happens when a single transaction in the Saga sequence fails? In that case, the Saga executes a series of compensating transactions. These transactions basically undo the changes made by the preceding transactions.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Types of Saga
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>There are basically two types of Saga. In other words, there are two ways in which you can implement the Saga Pattern.</p>
                        <h3>Choreography-Based Saga</h3>
                        <img src="media\gifs/choreography.png" alt="Choreography" style="width:70%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
                        <img src="media\gifs/choreography-saga-pattern.png" alt="Choreography Saga Pattern" style="width:70%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
                        <p>In this type of Saga Implementation, each service publishes one or more domain events. These domain events trigger local transactions in other microservices.</p>
                        <p>Let‚Äôs understand what is happening in the above example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Order Service is responsible for creating an Order. It also publishes an event for the same.</li>
                            <li>The Payment Service listens to that event and creates an Invoice.</li>
                            <li>When the Invoice is created, the Shipping Service creates the shipment.</li>
                            <li>When the Order is shipped, the Order Service updates the status of the Order.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now, this is a very simple example. In real life situations, there would be many business rules and steps involved to carry out such a distributed transaction. However, this example is only meant to demonstrate how Saga Pattern works.</p>
                        <p>The important thing to note here is that each service plays its part in the choreography. Each service is basically dependent on the events coming out from other services.</p>
                        <h3>Orchestration-Based Saga</h3>
                        <img src="media\images\orchestration-saga-pattern.png" alt="Orchestration Saga Pattern" style="width:70%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
                        <img src="media\images\orchestration-sequencing-logic.png" alt="Orchestration Sequencing Logic" style="width:70%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:0 auto;">
                        <p>In Orchestration-Based Saga, there is an orchestrator. An orchestrator can also be thought of as a manager that directs the participant services to execute local transactions.</p>
                        <p>Let‚Äôs understand what‚Äôs happening in this approach:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Order Service creates an Order. Then, it also creates the Order Management Saga.</li>
                            <li>The Order Management Saga sends a Create Invoice Command to the Payment Service.</li>
                            <li>The Payment Service creates the Invoice and responds back to the Order Management Saga. Note that these responses can be totally asynchronous and message-driven as well.</li>
                            <li>In the next step, the Order Management Saga issues the Create Shipping Command to the Shipping Service.</li>
                            <li>The Shipping Service does the needful and creates the Shipping. It also replies back to the Order Management Saga.</li>
                            <li>The Order Management Saga changes the status of the Order and ends the Saga‚Äôs life-cycle.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Saga Pattern ‚Äì Benefits and Drawbacks
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>The biggest benefit of Saga Pattern is that it allows an application to maintain data consistency across multiple services. This is very important from a Microservices Architecture point-of-view because it allows us to write our individual services without tight coupling. In case we run into a case for distributed transactions, we can utilize the Saga Pattern.</p>
                        <p>However, there are also drawbacks in this approach. The main point going against Saga Pattern is the fact that this pattern makes the programming model more complex. A simple example is developing compensating transactions in case anything goes wrong. Also, developers are usually not completely comfortable with this programming model. At least, not yet.</p>
                        <p>Other challenges include the topic of atomically updating the Aggregate state as well as publishing domain events.</p>
                        <p>Usually, Saga Pattern is applied in conjunction with some other patterns such as Event Sourcing and CQRS. These patterns specifically try to handle the scenarios around atomically updating the Aggregate‚Äôs state and publish events.</p>

            <li>What is High-Level Design (HLD)?
                <div class="answer">High-Level Design (HLD) involves the overall architecture and design of a system. It focuses on the system's structure, components, modules, and their interactions, providing a bird's-eye view of the system.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What are architectural diagrams?
                <div class="answer">Architectural diagrams are visual representations of the system's architecture, showing the major components, their interactions, and the overall structure of the system. They help in understanding the system's design and communication between stakeholders.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is the purpose of HLD?
                <div class="answer">The purpose of HLD is to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the system's architecture, ensuring that all components and modules are well-defined and their interactions are understood. It helps in identifying potential issues and making informed design decisions.</div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you create an architectural diagram?
                <div class="answer">To create an architectural diagram, identify the major components and modules of the system, define their responsibilities and interactions, and represent the overall structure using appropriate notations and symbols.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is the difference between HLD and LLD?
                <div class="answer">HLD focuses on the overall architecture and design of the system, providing a high-level view of the components and their interactions. LLD, on the other hand, focuses on the detailed design of individual components and modules, including implementation details and interactions between objects.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What are some common architectural patterns used in HLD?
                <div class="answer">Some common architectural patterns used in HLD include the Layered Architecture, Microservices Architecture, Event-Driven Architecture, and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).

        <ul>
            <li>What is Kubernetes?
                <div class="answer">Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently.</div>
            </li>
            <li>What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)?
                <div class="answer">Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft Azure. It simplifies the deployment, management, and operations of Kubernetes by offloading much of the operational overhead to Azure.</div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you create an AKS cluster?
                <div class="answer">You can create an AKS cluster using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure Resource Manager templates. For example, using the Azure CLI, you can create a cluster with the following command:
                    <pre><code>az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 3 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys</code></pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you deploy a Java microservice to AKS?
                <div class="answer">To deploy a Java microservice to AKS, you need to containerize your application using Docker, push the Docker image to a container registry, create Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files, and apply them to your AKS cluster using kubectl. For example:
                    <pre><code>kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml</code></pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you scale a deployment in AKS?
                <div class="answer">You can scale a deployment in AKS using the kubectl scale command. For example, to scale a deployment named my-deployment to 5 replicas, run:
                    <pre><code>kubectl scale deployment my-deployment --replicas=5</code></pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you monitor an AKS cluster?
                <div class="answer">You can monitor an AKS cluster using Azure Monitor for containers, which provides insights into the performance and health of your cluster. You can also use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for more advanced monitoring and visualization.</div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you update a deployment in AKS?
                <div class="answer">To update a deployment in AKS, you can modify the deployment YAML file and apply the changes using kubectl apply. For example:
                    <pre><code>kubectl apply -f updated-deployment.yaml</code></pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you roll back a deployment in AKS?
                <div class="answer">You can roll back a deployment in AKS using the kubectl rollout undo command. For example, to roll back the last deployment of my-deployment, run:
                    <pre><code>kubectl rollout undo deployment my-deployment</code></pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you expose a deployment in AKS?
                <div class="answer">You can expose a deployment in AKS by creating a Kubernetes service. For example, to expose a deployment named my-deployment as a LoadBalancer service, create a service YAML file and apply it using kubectl:
                    <pre><code>kubectl apply -f service.yaml</code></pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>How do you manage secrets in AKS?
                <div class="answer">You can manage secrets in AKS using Kubernetes Secrets. Create a secret using kubectl create secret and reference it in your deployment YAML file. For example:
                    <pre><code>kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=username=myuser --from-literal=password=mypassword</code></pre>
                </div>
            </li>
