            <div class="answer">
                To create a custom annotation in Java, you need to use the @interface keyword. You can also specify retention policies and target elements for the annotation. Here is an example:
                <pre><code>
        import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
        import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
        import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
        import java.lang.annotation.Target;

        @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
        @Target(ElementType.METHOD)
        public @interface MyCustomAnnotation {
            String value();
        }
                </code></pre>
                In this example, the custom annotation @MyCustomAnnotation can be applied to methods and has a retention policy of RUNTIME, meaning it will be available at runtime.
            </div>
